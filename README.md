Open classrooms project - Integrate a mobile website with animations in CSS

# Page Content
Homepage (x1)
● Display the location of restaurants. Eventually, it will be possible to choose
restaurants close to a certain place.
● A short presentation of the company.
● A section containing the four menus in the form of cards. When clicking on the card,
the user is redirected to the menu page.
Menu Pages (x4)
● Four pages each containing a restaurant menu.
Footer
● The footer is identical on all pages.
● When you click on Contact, a link to an email address is made.
Header
● The header is present on all pages.
● The home page contains the logo of the site.
● The menu pages contain a button to return to the home page.

# Graphic Effects and Animations
The effects accessible by clicking or hovering are visible on the model. They must use CSS
animations or transitions, no JavaScript, or library

Buttons
● When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The
drop shadow should also be more visible.
● Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped
Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it should fill up gradually.
For this first version, the effect can appear on hovering on desktop instead of
clicking.
Home Page
● When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this
mock-up, we would like to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3
seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS
animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is
welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter.
Menu Pages
● When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag.
They may appear either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert.
An example of the expected effect is provided.
● The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small
checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left.
For this first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering on desktop instead of
clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension
points.
