# Graphic Effects and Animations
The effects accessible by clicking or hovering are visible on the model. They must use CSS
animations or transitions, no JavaScript, or library

Buttons
<ul>
    <li>When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible.</li>
    <li>Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it should fill up gradually. For this first version, the effect can appear on hovering on desktop instead of clicking.</li>
</ul>

Home Page
When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this mock-up, we would like to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is welcome as long as it is  consistent with the graphic charter.

Menu Pages
<ul>
    <li>When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag. They may appear either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert.</li>
    <li>The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left.For this first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering on desktop instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension points.</li>
<ul>
